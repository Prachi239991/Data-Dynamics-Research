These specialty products aim to offer the same culinary enjoyment while addressing dietary needs and preferences. Additionally, linguine's role in meal preparation kits and convenience foods is expanding. Such kits provide consumers with pre-measured ingredients and recipes, streamlining meal preparation and offering a convenient solution for busy lifestyles.
